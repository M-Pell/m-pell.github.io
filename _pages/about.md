About Me
=====

I hail from San Diego, CA. There I spent much of my childhood surrounded by sailors, marines, and hockey players.

Like so many, I built my first computer with parts from the mom-and-pop computer store down the street. I fell in love with them and, while I have not always nurtured my skills, I always come back.

Now, I seek a challenge in the form of pursuing a degree in *Electrical Engineering*. The days are long and the sleep is sometimes nonexistent. The things that I've learned along the way though, I wouldn't have it any other way.

What I have found is that at some point every engineer finds their *project.* That project then turns into a life-long exercise to hone one's skills. My project is calling out to me, and it starts by converting a ICE vehicle into an EV. More to come as this project evolves.
